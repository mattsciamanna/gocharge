This is the React Native code for the IOS app that we have talked about.  It uses a handy little thing called Expo to automatically sync your code to a simulation that can be running on your phone.  It's truly brilliant.  You will have to download the Expo app for iPhone or Android.  See https://expo.io/.

To run it, just type `npm install` and `npm start`.  Then scan the QR code that shows up in the terminal window from within the Expo app.  Hopefully it will work.
